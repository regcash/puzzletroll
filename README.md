## Server-Side - server/
Using Node and Express we have created a REST API:
- GET /api/users/      responds with all users
- GET /api/users/:id  responds with user queried by provided id
- GET /api/users/me   responds with id of current user
- GET /api/users/checkChallenges    responds with completed challenges of current user
- POST /api/users/updateScore '''data={id: challengeID, score: challengeScore}''' adds the challenge from the given id to the user's list of completed challenges and adds the challenge's score to the user's total score.
- GET /api/challenges/  responds with all challenges
- GET /api/challenges/:challengeName  responds with the challenge matching the provided name
- POST /api/challenges/ ```data={
  name: challenge name,
  prompt: challenge prompt,
  answer: challenge answer,
  score: challenge score,
  difficulty: challenge difficulty
} ```
creates the provided challenge in the database
- GET /api/messages/  responds with all messages
- GET /api/messages/:challenge responds with all messages for a given challenge
- POST /api/messages/ ```data={
  name: username,
  message: message,
  challenge: challenge
} ``` adds the given message to the database

server.js uses router.js which uses handler.js for all API requests.

Server also uses PassportJS with Google OAuth authentcication. see server/config/auth.js and server/config/passport.js

## Client-Side - client/
- Client side uses Angular and Angular-route.
- client/index.html is our login page. Once a user has successfully authenticated via Google OAuth, they will be sent client/home/home.html.
- client/utils.js has the factory 'reqUtil' which manages the API calls for the user.
- client/app.js is the angularApp and manages states for each of html templates that will be rendered.
- Inside client/home/ we have angular controllers and views for challenge(+challengeAnswer view), challengeList, message, user.
